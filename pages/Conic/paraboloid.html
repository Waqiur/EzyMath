                <div class="content">
                    <h4 class="subheading">Elliptic Paraboloid</h4>
                    <p>In a suitable Cartesian coordinate system, an elliptic paraboloid has the
                        equation

                        \[
                        z = \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}
                        \]
                        If a = b, an elliptic paraboloid is a circular paraboloid or paraboloid of revolution. It is a
                        surface of
                        revolution
                        obtained by revolving a parabola around its axis.

                        Obviously, a circular paraboloid contains circles. This is also true in the general case (see
                        Circular section).

                        From the point of view of projective geometry, an elliptic paraboloid is an ellipsoid that is
                        tangent to the
                        plane
                        at infinity.</p>

                    <h4 class="subheading">Plane sections</h4>
                    <p>The plane sections of an elliptic paraboloid can be:

                    <p>&rightarrow; a parabola, if the plane is parallel to the axis,</p>
                    <p>&rightarrow; a point, if the plane is a tangent plane.</p>
                    <p>&rightarrow; an ellipse or empty, otherwise. </p>
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="subheading">Parabolic reflector</h4>
                    <p>On the axis of a circular paraboloid, there is a point called the focus (or
                        focal
                        point), such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light (or other waves) from a point source at
                        the focus is
                        reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the
                        other way around: a
                        parallel beam of light that is parallel to the axis of the paraboloid is concentrated at the
                        focal point. For a
                        proof, see Parabola § Proof of the reflective property.

                        Therefore, the shape of a circular paraboloid is widely used in astronomy for parabolic
                        reflectors and parabolic
                        antennas.

                        The surface of a rotating liquid is also a circular paraboloid. This is used in liquid-mirror
                        telescopes and in
                        making solid telescope mirrors (see rotating furnace).</p>

                <h4 class="heading">Hyperbolic paraboloid</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The hyperbolic paraboloid is a doubly ruled surface: it contains two families
                        of
                        mutually skew lines. The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each
                        other. Hence the
                        hyperbolic paraboloid is a conoid.

                        These properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest
                        definitions of hyperbolic
                        paraboloids: a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is
                        parallel to a
                        fixed
                        plane and crosses two fixed skew lines.

                        This property makes it simple to manufacture a hyperbolic paraboloid from a variety of materials
                        and for a
                        variety
                        of purposes, from concrete roofs to snack foods. In particular, Pringles fried snacks resemble a
                        truncated
                        hyperbolic paraboloid.

                        A hyperbolic paraboloid is a saddle surface, as its Gauss curvature is negative at every point.
                        Therefore,
                        although
                        it is a ruled surface, it is not developable.

                        From the point of view of projective geometry, a hyperbolic paraboloid is one-sheet hyperboloid
                        that is tangent
                        to
                        the plane at infinity.

                        A hyperbolic paraboloid of equation <span class="span-equation"> \( z = axy \) or \( z =
                            \frac{a}{2}(x^{2} - y^{2}) \)
                        </span> (this is the same up to a
                        rotation of axes)
                        may
                        be called a rectangular hyperbolic paraboloid, by analogy with rectangular hyperbolas.</p>

                    <p>Saddle roofs are often hyperbolic paraboloids as they are easily constructed

                        straight sections of material. Some examples:
